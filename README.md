# Overview

&#x20;

t-Triage is a tool that adds Intelligence in your Automation Testing process providing visibility, setting new workflows and saving time.

&#x20;Generally speaking, Automation Testing has 3 main phases:

1. Test creation
2. Test execution
3. Test Supervision / Validation

\
t-Triage focuses mainly on the third area, and overviews the first two. It validates how tests are being executed and **it sets a workflow for failed tests**.
